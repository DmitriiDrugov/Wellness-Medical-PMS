# REST API Reference

API-only backend. All responses use the envelope:

```jsonc
// success
{ "data": <payload>, "error": null }          // list endpoints also include "meta": { page, pageSize, total }
// failure
{ "data": null, "error": { "code": "STRING", "message": "STRING", "details": <optional> } }
```

**Auth:** send `Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>` on every endpoint except `POST /api/auth/login` and `POST /api/auth/refresh`.
**Money:** all `*Minor` fields are integer minor units (HUF × 100).
**Status codes:** 200 OK · 201 Created · 204 No Content · 401 Unauthorized · 403 Forbidden · 404 Not Found · 409 Conflict (booking/double-booking/closed folio) · 422 Validation.

Required capability per endpoint is shown in brackets; see [RBAC matrix](superpowers/specs/2026-06-08-pms-backend-design.md) (spec §7).

## Forms & Charting — Clinical (Phase 6)

housekeeping has no access. Every clinical read/write is audit-logged.

| GET / POST | `/api/form-templates` | submission:write / forms:manage | template definitions; PATCH bumps version |

| GET | `/api/intake-submissions` | submission:write | metadata only (no answers); query `guestId?, status?` |
| GET | `/api/intake-submissions/:id` | clinical:read | full answers (therapist-scoped, audited) |
| PATCH | `/api/intake-submissions/:id` | submission:write | update answers/status |
| GET | `/api/guests/:id/consents` | consent:read | full consent records (therapist-scoped) |
| POST | `/api/guests/:id/consents` | consent:write | grant `{ type, version, text?, docRef? }` |
| GET | `/api/guests/:id/consents/status` | consent:status:read | per-type status only (granted/revoked/none) |
| POST | `/api/consents/:id/revoke` | consent:write | sets revokedAt (history preserved) |
| POST | `/api/treatment-records` | clinical:write | `{ treatmentAppointmentId, subjective?, objective?, assessment?, plan?, productsUsed?, photoRefs? }` — 409 if required consent missing |
| GET | `/api/treatment-records` | clinical:read | query `guestId?, appointmentId?` (therapist-scoped) |
| GET | `/api/treatment-records/:id` | clinical:read | therapist-scoped, audited |
| PATCH | `/api/treatment-records/:id` | clinical:write | DRAFT only; 409 once signed |
| POST | `/api/treatment-records/:id/sign` | clinical:write | human signature locks the record |
| POST | `/api/treatment-records/:id/addendum` | clinical:write | new DRAFT superseding a signed record |

## Messaging & Guest Auth (Phase 10, revised)

Guests are authorized by **ownership** (own conversation only), not the RBAC matrix; the guest access
token carries `guestId` instead of a role. The AI receptionist books via the normal
reservation/appointment endpoints as a least-privilege `AI_AGENT` principal; every AI action is
append-only audit-logged with that actor.

### Guest auth
| Method | Path | Capability | Body / Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/guest-auth/login` | public | `{ email, password }` → `{ accessToken, refreshToken, tokenType, expiresIn }` |
| POST | `/api/guest-auth/refresh` | public | `{ refreshToken }` → new token pair (rotates refresh token) |
| POST | `/api/guest-auth/logout` | guest | `{ refreshToken }` → revokes it |
| POST | `/api/guest-auth/set-password` | invite token | `{ inviteToken, password }` → activates GuestAccount |
| GET | `/api/guest/me` | guest | own guest profile |

### Conversations & messages
| Method | Path | Capability | Body / Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/conversations/me` | guest | own conversation (created lazily on first fetch) |
| GET | `/api/conversations/me/messages` | guest | own messages; query: `since=<ISO\|id>` (polling cursor) |
| POST | `/api/conversations/me/messages` | guest | `{ body }` — appends a GUEST message; if the conversation is AI-handled, triggers an AI turn synchronously |
| GET | `/api/conversations` | messaging:read | staff list; query: `handling?, status?, page, pageSize`; therapists see only conversations belonging to guests they have an appointment with |
| GET | `/api/conversations/:id` | messaging:read | staff; therapist-scoped |
| GET | `/api/conversations/:id/messages` | messaging:read | query: `since=<ISO\|id>` (polling cursor) |
| POST | `/api/conversations/:id/messages` | messaging:write | staff reply: `{ body }` → STAFF message |
| POST | `/api/conversations/:id/take-over` | messaging:write | switches handling to HUMAN, assigns requesting staff member; audited STATE_CHANGE |
| POST | `/api/conversations/:id/release` | messaging:write | switches handling back to AI, clears assignment; audited STATE_CHANGE |
