# REST API Reference

API-only backend. All responses use the envelope:

```jsonc
// success
{ "data": <payload>, "error": null }          // list endpoints also include "meta": { page, pageSize, total }
// failure
{ "data": null, "error": { "code": "STRING", "message": "STRING", "details": <optional> } }
```

**Auth:** send `Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>` on every endpoint except `POST /api/auth/login` and `POST /api/auth/refresh`.
**Money:** all `*Minor` fields are integer minor units (HUF × 100).
**Status codes:** 200 OK · 201 Created · 204 No Content · 401 Unauthorized · 403 Forbidden · 404 Not Found · 409 Conflict (booking/double-booking/closed folio) · 422 Validation.
